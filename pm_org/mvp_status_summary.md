# AI Advancements Project - MVP Status Summary

## Where We Left Off
- **Completed Alphalens MVP**: Successfully developed and tested a standalone script (`alpha_validator_mvp.py`) that validates synthetic alpha factors using Alphalens-Reloaded.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Installed alphalens-reloaded (v0.4.6) and dependencies.
  - Generated synthetic pricing and factor data with controllable IC (~0.08 achieved vs. 0.07 target).
  - Produced Alphalens tear sheets (information and returns analysis PNGs).
  - Computed and saved summary metrics (IC mean, IR, quantile spread) to JSON.
  - Script runs headless, suitable for automation.
- **Outputs**: Located in `alpha_validator_mvp/outputs/` - tear sheet plots and `metrics_summary.json`.
- **Current State**: MVP is functional and demonstrates factor validation workflow. No errors on latest run (exit code 0).

## Next Steps
1. **Extend to Real Data**: Replace synthetic generator with DB fetches (e.g., from your Postgres setup) for pricing and factors.
2. **Add Persistence**: Log metrics to database (e.g., `factor_metrics` table) for historical tracking and dashboards.
3. **Regime Awareness**: Incorporate volatility regime grouping in Alphalens (e.g., `groupby=regime_labels`).
4. **Automation & Alerts**: Add threshold-based alerts (e.g., if IC < 0.05, flag for review).
5. **Integration**: Hook into your Strategy Engine as a validation step before RL training.
6. **Testing & Refinement**: Backtest on historical IBKR data; add unit tests; handle edge cases (sparse factors).
7. **Documentation**: Update README with real-data usage examples.

## Project Context
This MVP aligns with the broader AI Algorithmic Trading Advancements project, focusing on factor diagnostics to prevent weak signals from entering ML pipelines. Builds on your modular stack (Data → Strategy → Validator → DB).

## Action Items
- Review outputs and confirm metrics make sense.
- Decide on next extension (e.g., DB logging or real data).
- If ready, provide sample real factor DataFrame for integration testing.
