# TensorTrade MVP: Project Status Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-21

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the current status of the TensorTrade MVP project. The primary goal is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) trading agent using the TensorTrade framework, trained on historical stock data fetched from Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## 2. Current System State

The project is in the **training phase**. The data pipeline is stable, and the focus is now on successfully running the `train_mvp.py` script to train the PPO agent.

### What is Working:

*   **Data Pipeline (`mvp_pipeline.py`):**
    *   Successfully fetches historical daily price data for a watchlist of **150 symbols** for a **12-month period**.
    *   Connects to the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) gateway.
    *   Handles API rate limiting and batching.
*   **Database (`src/db_utils.py`):**
    *   Persists the fetched price data to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway.
    *   Uses an efficient `executemany` batch insertion method to handle large data volumes, significantly improving performance over the previous row-by-row approach.
    *   Database connection is stable and correctly configured via a `.env` file.
*   **Environment & Configuration:**
    *   All necessary Python dependencies are documented in `requirements.txt`.
    *   The environment correctly handles `asyncio` event loop conflicts in script-based execution by using `nest_asyncio`.
    *   Sensitive configurations like the `DATABASE_URL` are managed securely using a `.env` file.

### Current Focus & Blockers:

*   **Training Script (`train_mvp.py`):**
    *   This is the active area of development and debugging.
    *   The script is configured to use the full 150-symbol, 12-month dataset.
    *   **Redundancy:** The script currently re-fetches all historical data from IBKR, even if it already exists in the database. While functional, this is inefficient.
    *   **Recent Blocker:** The last run was halted by a `UnicodeDecodeError` during database insertion. A fix has been implemented to enforce `UTF-8` encoding on the database connection. The next run will validate this fix.

## 3. Key Achievements & Resolutions

The project has overcome several significant technical challenges to reach its current state:

1.  **Initial Setup & Rollback:** Reverted a broken state by using `git restore` to establish a clean baseline.
2.  **IBKR API Integration:**
    *   Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` for the custom `connect_me.py` module.
    *   Fixed IBKR API errors related to historical data request duration formats.
3.  **Database Performance:**
    *   Identified and resolved a major performance bottleneck where data was inserted row-by-row, causing the process to hang.
    *   Re-implemented the `upsert_price_bars` function in `db_utils.py` to use a batch `executemany` approach, enabling the efficient storage of over 50,000 price bars.
4.  **Environment & Dependency Management:**
    *   Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` for `tensortrade`, `gymnasium`, and `stable-baselines3` by adding them to `requirements.txt`.
    *   Resolved a `pip` build failure for the `numpy` package on Windows by using `conda` to install pre-compiled binaries.
5.  **Configuration & Scoping:**
    *   Fixed `ValueError: DATABASE_URL not set` by integrating `python-dotenv` into both `mvp_pipeline.py` and `train_mvp.py`.
    *   Resolved multiple `NameError` exceptions in `train_mvp.py` by moving function imports into the correct local scopes.
6.  **Concurrency Issues:**
    *   Fixed `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` by applying the `nest_asyncio` patch, allowing `ib_insync`'s async operations to run within the existing script context.
7.  **Database Encoding:**
    *   Addressed a `UnicodeDecodeError` from the `psycopg2` driver by explicitly setting the client encoding to `UTF-8` in the SQLAlchemy engine configuration.

## 4. System Architecture & Key Files

*   `data/tensorwatchlist.csv`: The input list of 150 stock symbols.
*   `.env`: Stores the `DATABASE_URL` for the PostgreSQL database.
*   `src/mvp_pipeline.py`: The initial script for populating the database with historical data.
*   `src/train_mvp.py`: The main script for training the RL agent. It orchestrates data loading, environment creation, and model training.
*   `src/db_utils.py`: A crucial utility module that handles all database interactions.
*   `src/watchlist_loader.py`: Contains the logic for loading symbols and fetching data from IBKR.
*   `requirements.txt`: Defines all Python package dependencies.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Validate Current Fix:** Run `train_mvp.py --months 12 --limit 150` to confirm that the `UnicodeDecodeError` is resolved and that the training process can begin.
2.  **Improve Training Script Efficiency:** Modify `train_mvp.py` to first check for existing data in the database before attempting to fetch it from IBKR. This will significantly speed up startup times.
3.  **Add Progress Indicators:** Enhance the script with more `print` statements or a progress bar to provide better feedback during long-running data loading and environment setup phases.
4.  **Complete Training & Evaluation:** Once the script runs reliably, let the PPO agent train and analyze the resulting evaluation metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.).
