)

# Prepare asset data
assets = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "TSLA", "SPY"]
returns_data = get_historical_returns(assets)  # Your data source
constraints = {
    "max_weight": 0.4,       # Maximum 40% in single asset
    "min_weight": 0.05,      # Minimum 5% in each asset
    "target_return": 0.12    # Target 12% annual return
}

# Optimize portfolio
best_portfolio = optimizer.optimize(
    expected_returns=returns_data.mean(),
    covariance_matrix=returns_data.cov(),
    constraints=constraints

    min_frequency=0.01,      # Minimum cycle length
    max_frequency=0.5,       # Maximum cycle length
    noise_threshold=0.1      # Filter out weak signals
)

# Analyze price data
price_data = get_price_history("AAPL", days=500)  # Your data source
analysis_result = analyzer.analyze(price_data)

# Extract signals
dominant_cycles = analysis_result.dominant_frequencies
trend_direction = analysis_result.trend_component
cycle_phases = analysis_result.phase_analysis

# Generate trading signals
if analysis_result.cycle_strength > 0.7:
    # Strong cyclical pattern detected
    if analysis_result.current_phase == "trough":

    scales=range(1, 64),     # Scale range for analysis
    sampling_period=1,       # Data sampling frequency
    significance_level=0.95  # Statistical significance threshold
)

# Analyze price data
price_data = get_price_history("AAPL", days=500)  # Your data source
wavelet_result = analyzer.analyze(price_data)

# Extract multi-scale insights
scalogram = wavelet_result.scalogram          # Time-frequency map
power_spectrum = wavelet_result.power_spectrum # Scale-averaged power
ridge_lines = wavelet_result.ridge_detection  # Dominant patterns

# Generate scale-specific signals
short_term_pattern = wavelet_result.get_scale_range(1, 10)   # 1-10 day patterns
medium_term_pattern = wavelet_result.get_scale_range(10, 50) # 2-10 week patterns
long_term_pattern = wavelet_result.get_scale_range(50, 200)  # Quarterly patterns
