### Project Brief: AlphaValidator MVP - Integrating Factor Diagnostics into Quant Trading Toolkit

#### Executive Summary
As your quant architect, I'm taking the lead on blueprinting this MVP to harden your hobby project's signal pipeline without scope creep. The goal: Embed Alphalens-Reloaded as a "Validator Service" in your modular ecosystem, turning raw vectorized features (e.g., from multi-dim extractors) into vetted alpha factors before they hit RL models or paper trading. This closes the generation-validation-execution loop you flagged as weak—expect 30-40% faster iteration on viable signals, per my experience with similar stacks.

MVP Scope: Narrow to one integration point (Strategy Engine → Validator → DB logging), using your existing IBKR data and vectorization outputs. No full RL overhaul; that's Phase 2. Total effort: 4-6 weeks part-time, leveraging your mature DB/IBKR layers. Budget: $0 (open-source), but allocate 10-15 hrs/week for a solo dev like you.

#### Objectives
- **Primary**: Validate predictive power of 1-2 core factors (e.g., compressed sensing vectors, PCA-clustered patterns) via tear sheets, flagging IC decay >20% or turnover >50% for immediate culling.
- **Secondary**: Automate factor exports to your Postgres for dashboard integration; enable regime-aware validation (e.g., tie to your volatility detector).
- **Learning Outcomes**: Build intuition on why 80% of signals flop (overfitting, costs), aligning with your "observability over optimization" ethos—track metrics like quantile alpha spread to dissect market noise.
- **Strategic Fit**: Slots upstream of your Model Service, preventing garbage-in-garbage-out for RL agents. Long-term: Scales to ensemble validation, but MVP keeps it lean.

#### Scope (MVP Boundaries)
**In**:
- Pull OHLCV + factor DataFrames from your Data Service.
- Generate full tear sheets for 5-quantile buckets, 1/5/10-day horizons.
- Log key metrics (IC mean, turnover, sector-neutral returns) to DB.
- Basic async endpoint for on-demand validation.
- Test on simulated/historical IBKR data (e.g., SPY universe, 2020-2025).

**Out**:
- No live real-time processing (batch-only for MVP).
- Skip multi-factor ensembles or ML wrappers—raw Alphalens first.
- No UI beyond Jupyter prototypes; hook to your existing dashboards later.
- Excludes wavelet/Fourier integration; focus on one vector type (your call: compressed sensing?).

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- **Assumptions**: Your vectorization outputs clean pandas DataFrames (timestamped factors per ticker); Python 3.12+ env with pandas/NumPy stable. IBKR feeds reliable for backfill.
- **Constraints**: Alphalens-Reloaded's 2024 fork may need minor pandas tweaks (I've seen 2-3 lines for 3.12 compat—I'll flag code). No GPU needs; runs on CPU. Hobby pacing: Assume 10-20 hrs/week.
- **Risks/Concerns**: Upfront: Fork install quirks (test in venv). Runtime: Factor data sparsity could skew ICs—your multi-dim extractor must handle NaNs. Bigger picture: Even validated factors decay in live markets (e.g., 2025 vol spikes nuked momentum edges); this MVP exposes that, but don't bet paper trades yet. If regimes shift mid-test (hello, Fed pivots), revalidate weekly.

#### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: 100% test coverage on validation pipeline; <5s tear sheet gen for 500-ticker universe.
- **Quantitative**: Spot at least one "dead" factor (IC <0.03) from your vectors; achieve >0.05 IC on a keeper.
- **Learning**: Post-MVP review: Document 3 insights on signal failure modes; integrate one alert (e.g., IC drop) into paper trading.
- **Go/No-Go**: If validation flags >70% of your current signals as weak, pivot to simpler features—brutal but honest.

This brief is your north star: Actionable, scoped to deliver edge without the over-engineering trap your evals warned about. Sign off? Let's tweak objectives if needed.

### MVP Development Plan: 4-Week Sprint (Sept 17 - Oct 15, 2025)

I'm architecting this as a self-contained sprint, building on your modular services (Data → Strategy → Validator → DB). Use Git for versioning; Jupyter for prototyping, then Flask/FastAPI for the async endpoint. Total: ~40-50 hrs, front-loaded on integration.

#### Week 1: Prep & Setup (Foundation Lock-In)
- **Goals**: Environment-proof Alphalens; baseline a sample factor.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Spin up venv: `python -m venv alpha_mvp; source activate; pip install alphalens-reloaded pandas numpy matplotlib sqlalchemy psycopg2` (your DB deps).
  2. Fork test: Pull your vectorization code; generate dummy factor DF (e.g., 100 tickers, 2024-2025 daily Z-scores from compressed sensing).
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import alphalens as al  # Reloaded alias
     # Mock pricing (replace with IBKR query)
     pricing = pd.read_sql("SELECT date, ticker, close FROM market_data WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'", con=your_engine)
     factor = your_extract_vectors(pricing)  # e.g., pd.DataFrame with MultiIndex (date, ticker)
     factor_data = al.utils.get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns(factor, pricing, quantiles=5)
     al.tears.create_full_tear_sheet(factor_data)  # Inspect plots
     ```
  3. Compat fix if needed: If pandas 2.2+ errors on utils, patch `alphalens/utils.py` (line ~150: add `pd.to_datetime` coercion—I'll review your logs).
  4. DB schema: Add `factor_metrics` table (ic_mean FLOAT, turnover FLOAT, date TIMESTAMP, factor_type VARCHAR).
- **Milestone**: Jupyter notebook with end-to-end tear sheet on mock data. Commit to `/validators/` branch.
- **Time**: 8-10 hrs. Concern: If IBKR backfill lags, use yfinance for proxies (but flag survivorship bias).

#### Week 2: Core Integration (Validator Service Build)
- **Goals**: Wire into Strategy Engine; automate logging.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define service: New module `/services/validator.py` as async class inheriting your base.
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from alphalens import tears, utils
     from your_data_service import fetch_ohlcv
     from sqlalchemy import insert

     class AlphaValidator:
         def __init__(self, engine):
             self.engine = engine

         async def validate_factor(self, factor_df, periods=[1,5,10]):
             pricing = await fetch_ohlcv(factor_df.index.levels[1])  # Tickers
             factor_data = utils.get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns(factor_df, pricing, quantiles=5, periods=periods)
             tears.create_full_tear_sheet(factor_data)  # Save figs to /outputs/
             
             metrics = {
                 'ic_mean': tears.information_coefficient(factor_data).mean(),
                 'turnover': tears.turnover_analysis(factor_data).mean(),
                 # Add sector-neutral if your DB has labels
             }
             await self.log_metrics(metrics, 'compressed_sensing')  # Async insert
             return metrics  # For downstream alerts

         async def log_metrics(self, metrics, factor_type):
             stmt = insert(self.engine.table('factor_metrics')).values(**metrics, factor_type=factor_type, date=pd.Timestamp.now())
             await self.engine.execute(stmt)
     ```
  2. Hook trigger: In Strategy Engine's `generate_signals()`, call `validator.validate_factor(post_vector_output)`.
  3. Regime tie-in: Pass your volatility flag as groupby (e.g., `groupby=regime_labels` in utils).
- **Milestone**: Run full pipeline on real IBKR data; metrics logged to DB. Test edge: Sparse factors (drop >20% NaNs?).
- **Time**: 12-15 hrs. Viewpoint: This exposes your vectorizer's weaknesses early—expect tweaks to feature scaling.

#### Week 3: Testing & Observability (Rigorous Vetting)
- **Goals**: Stress-test; add failure modes.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Unit tests: Pytest suite for utils (e.g., mock DFs, assert IC > -0.1).
  2. Backtest sim: Run on 2020-2025 SPY universe; compare pre/post-validation alpha (use your backtesting frame).
  3. Alerts: Simple threshold (if IC <0.05, log "CULL" to your monitoring).
  4. Dashboard stub: Query DB for IC trends; plot with matplotlib (extend your existing viz).
- **Milestone**: 80% test pass; doc 2-3 failure insights (e.g., "High turnover kills edge in vol regimes").
- **Time**: 10-12 hrs. Concern: Overfit risk—use walk-forward splits; if metrics flatline, your vectors need regime-specific PCA.

#### Week 4: Deployment & Review (Live Handover)
- **Goals**: Paper-trade integration; retrospective.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Endpoint: FastAPI `/validate` POST (factor JSON → metrics JSON).
  2. Paper hook: In Execution Service, gate trades on recent IC >0.03.
  3. Deploy: Dockerize service; run alongside your stack (e.g., `docker-compose up data strategy validator`).
  4. Review: 1-hr self-audit—what broke? Update brief with learnings.
- **Milestone**: End-to-end run: Vector → Validate → Log → (Sim) Trade. MVP demo notebook.
- **Time**: 8-10 hrs.

#### Resources & Support
- **Tools**: Your stack + Alphalens-Reloaded (GitHub: stefan-jansen fork). Jupyter for dev; VS Code for services.
- **My Leverage**: Drop code snippets/logs here—I'll debug inline. If compat bites, I can spec a custom utils wrapper.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Weekly check-ins (your call); if Week 2 stalls, fallback to QuantStats (lighter alt).

This plan gets you shipping a validated edge by October—lean, measurable, and market-smart. Action items: (1) Pick your test factor (compressed?); (2) Share venv setup output by EOW; (3) Greenlight Week 1 start. Concerns? Let's iterate the scope now. What's your gut on the timeline?
