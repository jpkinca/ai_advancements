FAISS for Financial Pattern Recognition: Technical Deep Dive
FAISS Architecture & Core Concepts
Vector Space Foundation
FAISS operates on the principle that similar patterns can be represented as nearby points in high-dimensional vector space. For financial data, this means converting time series, price movements, or chart patterns into dense numerical vectors where Euclidean or cosine distance correlates with pattern similarity.

Key Distance Metrics:

Euclidean Distance: Best for absolute magnitude differences (price levels, volume spikes)
Cosine Similarity: Ideal for directional patterns regardless of scale (normalized returns, momentum indicators)
Inner Product: Useful for correlation-based similarity in multi-asset comparisons
Index Types & Trade-offs
Exact Search Indexes:

IndexFlatL2: Brute force, 100% accuracy, O(n) complexity
IndexFlatIP: Inner product variant for correlation searches
Use case: Small datasets (<100K vectors), backtesting validation
Approximate Indexes:

IndexIVFFlat: Inverted file system, 10-100x faster, 95-99% recall
IndexIVFPQ: Product quantization, massive compression, 90-95% recall
IndexHNSW: Hierarchical navigable small world, excellent speed/accuracy balance
Use case: Production systems, real-time pattern matching
Financial Data Vectorization Strategies
Time Series Embedding Approaches
1. Statistical Feature Vectors

python
# Generate 50-dimensional feature vector from price data
features = [
    returns.mean(), returns.std(), returns.skew(), returns.kurtosis(),
    bollinger_position, rsi_14, macd_signal, volume_profile,
    support_resistance_levels, trend_strength, volatility_regime
]
2. Technical Indicator Embeddings Transform multiple indicators into unified vectors:

Moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50, 200-day convergence/divergence)
Oscillators (RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R)
Volume indicators (OBV, Volume Rate of Change)
Volatility measures (ATR, Bollinger Band width)
3. Deep Learning Embeddings

Autoencoder approach: Compress 100-day price sequences into 64-dim vectors
LSTM embeddings: Use hidden states as pattern representations
Transformer encodings: Attention-based patterns for market regime detection
Chart Pattern Vectorization
Geometric Pattern Encoding:

Convert candlestick patterns to shape descriptors
Extract trend lines, support/resistance as geometric features
Encode pattern duration, amplitude, and volume characteristics
Image-Based Approach:

Render charts as standardized images (256x256 pixels)
Use pre-trained CNN (ResNet-50) to extract feature vectors
Fine-tune on financial pattern dataset for domain-specific embeddings

    # Adjust Kelly formula by pattern similarity confidence
    similarity_weight = 1 - np.mean([sim[1] for sim in pattern_similarity])
    kelly_fraction = (win_rate * avg_win - (1-win_rate) * avg_loss) / avg_win
