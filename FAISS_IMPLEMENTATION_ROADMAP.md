# FAISS Pattern Recognition Trading System - Implementation Roadmap

**Current Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Project Status**: Pattern Generators Complete, Database Schema Ready  
**Missing Component**: Pattern Data Generation & Integration Pipeline  

## Executive Summary

We have sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms (CANSLIM, SEPA, Warrior Trading) and a production-ready PostgreSQL schema, but need to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This roadmap takes us from proof-of-concept to production trading system.

## Conclusion

This roadmap takes us from our current state (sophisticated pattern generators + database schema) to a fully operational FAISS-powered trading system in 8 weeks. The key insight is that we need to bridge the gap between having the code and having the data - once we generate actual patterns from real market data and populate our FAISS indexes, we'll have a powerful pattern recognition trading system.

The modular approach allows us to start small (10 stocks) and scale up systematically while maintaining system reliability and performance. Each phase builds on the previous one, reducing risk and ensuring continuous progress toward our goal of AI-enhanced trading decisions.

**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation  
**Next Action**: Create `data_collection/historical_data_fetcher.py`  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks to full production system  
**Success Probability**: High (building on solid foundation)
