- Create specialized collections for trading data types
- Integrate with existing PostgreSQL database schema
- Implement embedding generation for market patterns

#### Phase 3.2: AI Module Enhancement (Days 3-4)
- **ChromaEnhanced PPO Trader**: RL with historical pattern context
- **Pattern-Aware Genetic Optimization**: Evolution guided by similar strategies
- **Memory-Enhanced Spectrum Analysis**: Spectral patterns with historical outcomes
- Database integration for all enhanced modules

#### Phase 3.3: Advanced Pattern Intelligence (Days 5-7)
- Multi-modal market data embedding (price + news + sentiment)
- Real-time pattern recognition and similarity scoring
- Intelligent trade journal with semantic search
- Cross-asset correlation discovery system

## üöÄ Week 4: Advanced Features & Integration
- **Goal:** Production-ready features and TradeAppComponents integration.
- **Planned Features:**
  - Real-time sentiment analysis integration
  - Advanced market regime detection
  - Multi-timeframe pattern correlation
  - Performance attribution analytics
  - Integration with existing trading platform

## üè≠ Week 5: Production Deployment & Optimization
- **Goal:** Deploy to production with monitoring and optimization.
- **Planned Activities:**
  - Railway PostgreSQL production deployment
  - Performance optimization and scaling
  - Monitoring and alerting systems
  - User interface integration
  - Production validation and testing

## Recommended Integration Timing
- Integrate after MVP is validated and incremental improvements ensure stability (typically after step 3).
- Use staging environment for initial integration, then move to production after successful tests.
