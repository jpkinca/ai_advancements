### Project Brief: MVP Development for Chain-of-Alpha Framework POC

#### Overview
As your advisor on this POC, I'll outline a tightly scoped MVP to demonstrate the Chain-of-Alpha Framework's technical feasibility in Python, leveraging your existing IBKR integration and TradingView setup. This draws from the arXiv paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06312) and focuses solely on proving the dual-chain architecture can generate and optimize interpretable alpha factors for stock return prediction. The MVP will use a minimal dataset and open-source tools to validate benefits like improved backtest Sharpe ratios (target: >1.0 vs. baseline), without overcomplicating. Concerns upfront: LLM inference can be computationally intensive—test on a GPU if available, or use API fallbacks to avoid delays. Also, alphas from the paper were China-focused; US adaptations may require prompt tweaks for market nuances.

This MVP establishes a foundational Python module that's extensible—e.g., swap LLMs, add datasets, or hook into IBKR for live signals—enabling full capabilities later without rework.

#### Goals
1. **Prove Technical Feasibility**: Build and run a end-to-end dual-chain system that generates candidate factors and optimizes them via backtesting feedback, all in Python.
2. **Validate Anticipated Benefits**: Achieve measurable alpha discovery (e.g., 5-10 viable factors) that outperforms a simple benchmark strategy in backtests, confirming potential for 5-15% return uplift as hinted in benchmarks.

Success Metrics: 
- System runs without errors on sample data.
- Optimized factors yield Sharpe ratio >1.0 in backtests (vs. <0.5 baseline like buy-and-hold).
- Total development time: 20-40 hours, assuming your Python proficiency.

#### Scope
- **Inclusions**: Python implementation of Factor Generation Chain (LLM-prompted idea creation) and Factor Optimization Chain (iterative backtesting refinement). Use free LLM (e.g., Llama 3 via Hugging Face), yfinance for data, and VectorBT for backtesting. Limit to 10 US stocks (e.g., FAANG +5), 5-year historical data, 3-5 optimization iterations.
- **Exclusions**: No production deployment, UI, real-time data, IBKR live execution, TradingView full integration (just export hooks), advanced ML tuning, or multi-asset support. No handling of edge cases like API rate limits or overfitting mitigation beyond basics.

#### Essential Tasks
Execute in sequence for efficiency; each builds on the prior. Use your existing Python env with IBKR libs.

1. **Environment Setup (2-4 hours)**: Install required packages (Hugging Face Transformers, yfinance, pandas, VectorBT) via pip. Download and configure a local LLM model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) or set up API access (e.g., Grok/Hugging Face inference). Write a test script to verify LLM prompt-response and data pull.

2. **Data Acquisition (2 hours)**: Write a Python script to fetch and preprocess 5-year OHLCV data for 10 selected US stocks via yfinance. Store in a pandas DataFrame; compute basic features (e.g., returns, volume) as input for chains.

3. **Implement Factor Generation Chain (4-6 hours)**: Code a Python function using the LLM to generate 20-30 candidate alpha factors from prompts (e.g., "Generate 10 interpretable factors using price, volume, and momentum for stock return prediction"). Output as executable Python expressions (e.g., "df['close'].pct_change(5) / df['volume'].rolling(5).mean()").

4. **Implement Factor Optimization Chain (6-8 hours)**: Build a loop that evaluates generated factors via VectorBT backtesting (long-only strategy on holdout data). Use LLM prompts for refinement (e.g., "Improve this factor based on backtest Sharpe: X"). Iterate 3-5 times per factor, selecting top 5-10 optimized ones.

5. **Integration Hooks and Evaluation (4-6 hours)**: Add stub functions to export optimized factors as CSV for IBKR import or Pine Script snippets for TradingView visualization. Run full end-to-end on the dataset; compute metrics (Sharpe, returns) vs. baseline. Document results in a Jupyter notebook for review.

#### Timeline and Resources
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks part-time (18-24 hours total), starting immediately.
- **Resources Needed**: Your Python setup + GPU (optional for faster LLM). Free tools only—no paid APIs required initially. Budget: $0, assuming open-source.
- **My Role**: I can provide code skeletons or debug guidance in follow-ups to accelerate.

#### Risks and Mitigations
- **LLM Variability**: Outputs may be inconsistent; mitigate by fixing seeds and refining prompts iteratively.
- **Data/Backtest Bias**: Small dataset risks overfitting; use train/test splits strictly.
- **Performance Issues**: If local LLM is slow, switch to API— but note potential costs.
- **No-Go Scenario**: If chains fail to converge (e.g., Sharpe <0.5), pivot to simpler RL as discussed previously; this POC tests that early.

This brief keeps us laser-focused—build, test, validate. Let's refine if needed before kickoff.
