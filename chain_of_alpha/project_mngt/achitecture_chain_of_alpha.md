### Architectural Plan: High-Level Components and Platform Structure for Chain-of-Alpha MVP

As the architect leading this POC, I'll outline a clean, modular architecture that's Python-centric, extensible, and aligned with your retail trading setup. This design prioritizes simplicity to prove feasibility—focusing on a pipeline structure with clear data flows—while avoiding over-engineering. We're building a foundational "alpha engine" that can later integrate with IBKR and TradingView without major refactors. My viewpoint: This setup leverages open-source tools for zero-cost prototyping, but I'll flag a key concern upfront—LLM inference latency could bottleneck iterations on CPU-only hardware; if that's an issue, we'll pivot to API-based LLMs early to maintain momentum.

The overall structure is a linear pipeline wrapped in a Jupyter notebook for easy iteration, with modular functions for reusability. It follows a "data-in, alphas-out" flow: Ingest data → Generate candidates → Optimize via feedback → Evaluate and export. No databases or servers needed; everything runs locally or via lightweight APIs. Extensibility points: Each component as a separate module (e.g., `generation.py`, `optimization.py`) for future scaling (e.g., add multiprocessing for more stocks or cloud deployment).

- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional with feedback loops only in optimization (LLM refines based on backtest results). Inputs are raw OHLCV; outputs are refined factor expressions and metrics.
- **Integration Points**: Hooks for IBKR (e.g., factor signals as API calls) and TradingView (export as indicators) are stubs here, but designed as pluggable outputs.

#### Core Components and Structure
I'll break this down by component, including purpose, inputs/outputs, tech implementation, and dependencies. This is a monolithic script structure initially (for speed), refactorable to classes/modules post-MVP.

1. **Data Acquisition Module**
   - **Purpose**: Fetch and preprocess market data to feed the chains. Keeps scope narrow by handling only historical OHLCV.
   - **Inputs**: Stock tickers (list of 10), date range (5 years).
   - **Outputs**: Pandas DataFrame with features (e.g., close, volume, returns); train/test splits.
   - **Implementation**: Python function using yfinance for pulls, pandas for cleaning/splits. No caching yet—concern: API limits could throttle; mitigate with local saves.
   - **Dependencies**: yfinance, pandas.
   - **Extensibility**: Add IBKR historical API as alternative source.

2. **LLM Interface**
   - **Purpose**: Abstracted wrapper for LLM interactions, ensuring consistent prompting across chains. This is the "brain" enabling AI-driven generation.
   - **Inputs**: Prompt strings, optional context (e.g., data samples).
   - **Outputs**: Parsed text responses (e.g., factor expressions).
   - **Implementation**: Hugging Face Transformers for local Llama-3-8B inference (or API fallback like Grok/OpenAI). Use fixed seeds for reproducibility.
   - **Dependencies**: transformers library.
   - **Extensibility**: Swap models (e.g., to Grok for better finance tuning) or add multi-agent setups later.
   - **Concern**: Local models consume RAM (8-16GB); if crashes occur, default to API to hit timelines.

3. **Factor Generation Chain**
   - **Purpose**: Use LLM to brainstorm interpretable alpha candidates, proving the "creative" side of the framework.
   - **Inputs**: Preprocessed data features; generation prompts (e.g., "Generate 10 factors using price/volume").
   - **Outputs**: List of 20-30 Python-evaluable expressions (e.g., "df['close'].rolling(5).mean() / df['volume']").
   - **Implementation**: Function chaining LLM calls with parsing logic (regex/string eval to convert to code).
   - **Dependencies**: LLM Interface, Data Acquisition.
   - **Extensibility**: Add prompt templates for domain-specific alphas (e.g., volatility-focused).

4. **Backtesting Engine**
   - **Purpose**: Evaluate factors quantitatively, providing feedback for optimization. VectorBT chosen for its speed and Python-native vectorized ops.
   - **Inputs**: Factor expressions, test dataset.
   - **Outputs**: Metrics (Sharpe ratio, returns, drawdown) for each factor.
   - **Implementation**: Custom VectorBT strategy class (long-only on factor thresholds); run simulations in batch.
   - **Dependencies**: vectorbt library.
   - **Extensibility**: Integrate with IBKR's paper trading API for forward-testing.
   - **Concern**: Small dataset (10 stocks) may not generalize; we'll monitor metrics and flag if variance is high.

5. **Factor Optimization Chain**
   - **Purpose**: Iterative refinement loop to optimize candidates, closing the feedback cycle and validating benefits.
   - **Inputs**: Candidate factors, backtest metrics.
   - **Outputs**: Top 5-10 refined factors with improved metrics.
   - **Implementation**: Loop (3-5 iterations): Backtest → Prompt LLM with results (e.g., "Improve factor X for higher Sharpe") → Regenerate → Repeat.
   - **Dependencies**: Factor Generation Chain, Backtesting Engine, LLM Interface.
   - **Extensibility**: Add genetic algorithms or RL for automated (non-LLM) optimization in v2.

6. **Evaluation & Export Module**
   - **Purpose**: Aggregate results and prepare for external use, proving end-to-end value.
   - **Inputs**: Optimized factors, metrics.
   - **Outputs**: Jupyter report (metrics table); CSV of factors; basic Pine Script stubs.
   - **Implementation**: Pandas for tables; file writers for exports.
   - **Dependencies**: All prior components.
   - **Extensibility**: Full IBKR hook (e.g., via ib_insync lib) for signal execution; TradingView API for auto-indicator upload.

#### Platform Structure Overview
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.10+; libs: transformers, yfinance, pandas, vectorbt. Jupyter for dev/run; Git for versioning.
- **Deployment**: Local execution only—no cloud. Run as `python main.py` or notebook cells.
- **Configuration**: Single config file (e.g., YAML) for tickers, prompts, iterations—easy tweaks.
- **Error Handling**: Basic try-except for LLM parses and API calls; logging to console/file.
- **Performance**: Target <5min per full run on GPU; scale by batching.
- **Security/Compliance**: No sensitive data; but note: LLMs could hallucinate invalid code—validate expressions before eval().

This architecture is robust yet minimal—delivering a working POC that hits our goals without bloat. Concerns: If LLM costs creep in (API usage), cap at $10; and ensure ethical use (backtests only, no live trades). Next step: I'll draft code skeletons for Task 1-2 in our next interaction to kickstart Week 1. Confirm if this aligns, or any adjustments?
