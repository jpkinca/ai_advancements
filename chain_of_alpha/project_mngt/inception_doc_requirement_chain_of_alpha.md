### Additional Documentation for Inception Phase

As your lead architect and advisor on this Chain-of-Alpha MVP POC, I'll cut straight to what's essential beyond what we have (Project Brief, Project Plan, and Architectural Plan). Inception phase—drawing from standard SDLC practices like RUP or agile discovery—is about establishing vision, scope, and viability without bloating the process. For a lean POC like ours, we don't need exhaustive docs; over-documenting kills momentum, especially as a solo dev/trader. My viewpoint: Focus on artifacts that mitigate risks (e.g., unclear requirements leading to scope creep) and prove value early. Concerns: If we skip these, we risk misalignment on goals or overlooked pitfalls; but add too many, and we delay coding.

Based on best practices, here's the minimal "other" documentation we need to round out inception. I'll outline each with purpose, contents, and effort estimate—keeping it targeted to our Python-based, AI-driven alpha discovery scope. These build on our existing foundation and enable smoother transitions to construction/elaboration phases. Total added effort: 4-8 hours, spread over Week 1.

1. **High-Level Requirements Specification (SRS or Requirements Document)**
   - **Purpose**: Defines what the MVP must do (functional/non-functional needs) to prove feasibility and benefits, ensuring we're building the right thing. This prevents vague alphas or mismatched metrics.
   - **Key Contents**:
     - Functional: E.g., "Generate 20-30 candidate factors via LLM; optimize via 3-5 backtest iterations; export to CSV/Pine Script."
     - Non-Functional: E.g., "Run on local Python env; Sharpe >1.0 target; handle 10 stocks/5-year data."
     - Prioritized user stories: E.g., "As a trader, I want automated alpha mining so I can integrate with IBKR."
     - Assumptions/Constraints: E.g., "Free LLMs only; no real-time trading."
   - **Format**: 2-3 page Markdown/Google Doc; use bullet points or table for clarity.
   - **Effort**: 2-3 hours (Sep 13-14). Owner: You, with my review for gaps.

2. **Risk Register**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies, assesses, and plans mitigations for top risks, like LLM inconsistencies or poor backtest results, to safeguard our 2-3 week timeline. This is critical for a novel AI POC where tech feasibility is unproven.
   - **Key Contents** (Table Format):
     - Risk: Description, probability (low/med/high), impact, mitigation (e.g., "LLM hallucination: High prob, med impact—use seeded prompts and manual validation").
     - Top 5-10: Include tech (e.g., GPU shortages), project (e.g., time overruns), and domain (e.g., market data biases).
     - Owner/Status: Assign to us; track as "Open."
   - **Format**: Simple Excel/Google Sheet or Markdown table.
   - **Effort**: 1-2 hours (Sep 15). Owner: Me to draft initial list based on prior concerns; you refine.

3. **Project Glossary**
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies key terms (e.g., "alpha factor," "Sharpe ratio") to avoid misunderstandings, especially with finance-AI jargon in our framework.
   - **Key Contents**: 10-15 terms with definitions (e.g., "Chain-of-Alpha: Dual LLM architecture for factor generation and optimization per arXiv paper").
   - **Format**: 1-page list in the Project Brief appendix.
   - **Effort**: 1 hour (Sep 16). Owner: You, pulling from paper and our plans.

That's it—no business case (our Brief covers value/ROI), no detailed designs (Architecture Plan suffices), and no prototypes yet (that's the MVP build). These docs will total <10 pages, ensuring we're lean while de-risking. Let's integrate them into the plan: Add as subtasks in Week 1, review end-of-week. If this feels off-base for your retail setup, we can trim further—your call.
